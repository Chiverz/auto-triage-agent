Provide what you believe to be the highest priority follow up question you would ask the business stakeholder, asking only a single question until you have no further questions and give the why?

Make sure that the question is short and focused and not overloaded so that the business stakeholder can provide a short focused response. More questions can be asked afterwards.

Ensure you explain what kind of information you are expecting so that the business stakeholder can clearly grasp what the questions are aimed at so that they can provide detailed and accurate responses.

Please note that the business stakeholder will likely have limited knowledge of technical software and integration details and is focused on the business and product delivery rather than the technical delivery.""",
